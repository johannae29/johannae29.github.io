          <h2>Project information</h2>
          <p>
             We were given a brief/pitch to create at datingapp or site where the users should talk or chat with each other to be able to unlock pieces of pictures of them
             self and the person they talk to. Instead of "matching" based on pictures, you get the chance to first talk to the person before the pictures matter. 
             In this way the matching process are  done based on interests and what they write. The project was a 2 week assignment for the course <i>Tools for prototype production</i>
             and I choose to work with the design thinking process during this project. 
          </p>

        <div class="portfolio-description">
          <h2>Empathize</h2>
          <p><b>Research</b></p>
          <p><ul>
            <li>Tinder is largest among younger people, 16-27 years old, and involves sweeping yes or no based on pictures.</li>
            <li>Many apps require that both users have liked each other for it to be a match.</li>
            <li>The Relate app is based on "research that shows that a common set of values is one of the most important factors for love in relationships".</li>
            <li>Paid versions provide more features, affects my success factor and provide a larger selection (more matches).
               However, The Famous Jam Study shows that a smaller sample makes it easier to choose.</li>
            <li>There is also a study done on Tinder that shows that profiles that have more than three images are more successful than profiles with only one image.</li>
          </ul></p>
          <p>In order to keep and get new users, the app must feel exciting with a little twist when the users do not see pictures of each other. 
            The matches are made mainly on the basis of values, but interests should be a smaller part as e.g. conversations starters.</p>
          <p>As the target group is large and the idea is that users should get to know each other before they get to see pictures, 
            I prioritize users who have similar values and interests and want to find a long-term relationship.</p>
          <h2>Define</h2>
          <p>There is a large selection of dating apps. They are often superficial and the a large selection to choose of. Many people meet online, 
            but it is difficult to find the right one when the focus is on the superficial instead of what is on the inside.
            The focus of the project should be on users finding the right one by getting to know each other. But also the number of matching suggestions, 
            how often and how many matching suggestions are displayed.</p>
          <h2>Ideate</h2>
          <b>Point of View</b>
          <p>By focusing on important information, such as values, and a limited selection of matches in dating apps, 
            more singles will get to know each other and create the conditions for a long-term relationship.</p>
          <b>HMW-questions</b>
          <p>Utifrån POV skapade jag HMW-frågor för att kunna angripa problemet från så många håll som möjligt. [4]
            Där efter gick jag vidare till brainstorming för att få fram ännu fler idéer.
            Lägg till bild här eller samla alla bilder på samma ställe.</p>
          <p><b>Brainstorming</b></p>
          <p>Hur vill jag hantera meny? En som alltid är synlig i nederkant eller en som öppnas från övre högra hörnet?
            Ska bilder våra suddiga och bli mindre och mindre suddiga? Eller ska bilden låsas upp med en pusselbit i taget?</p>
          <p><b>User journey</b></p>
          <p>Lägg till bild här eller överst</p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Prototype</h2>
          <b>Low-fi prototype</b>
          <p>I started by creating a low-fi prototype in Balsamiq to be able to test my ideas early and see if they hold.
            When users create their profile, I wanted it to be easy and relatively fast, hence I have opted out of free text
            fields where the user can describe themselves. Instead, the user fills in values using sliders. Selects predefined interests in a 
            dropdown to minimize the risk of mismatches due to spelling errors. In order for users to have as much time as possible to get to 
            know each other, I choose to show new suggestions only once a week and then at a time when they have time to get in touch.</p>
          <p>After talking / chatting with each other for a certain time, the pictures are unlocked, puzzle piece by puzzle piece, which should create some excitement if you have had good contact with someone.
            It must be possible to communicate via chat or voice calls to avoid changing the medium or giving out, for example, telephone numbers, which means that users stay in PiXER.
            When all puzzle pieces are unlocked, it is also possible to communicate via video call.</p>
          <p>Test of Low-fi prototype</p>
          <p>Man, 47
            More options for when to display matching suggestions.
            It would have been good if it was possible to unlock pictures earlier if both agree.
            Missing free text fields, as it can be interesting how to see how to describe yourself.</p>
          <p><b>High-fi prototype</b></p>
          <p>I'll add more matching suggestions.
            When matching criteria, I also add whether I myself or the person I am looking for have children or not.
            Early unlocking of images and free text fields I wait with until more tests are done.
            The prototype was faintly pink at an early stage, which was not well received by male testers. Which made me switch to the current color theme.</p>
          <p>Test of High-fi prototype</p>
          <p>Woman, 31 & Man, 40
            Lacks information about whether I or the person I am looking for have children. Is it interesting to be able to fill in if I want children or not?
            When creating a profile, users had appreciated text on the buttons instead of an arrow.
            Likes that it is possible to call in the app to avoid giving out their number.
            A question that arose: can you cheat yourself of the pictures being unlocked by starting a chat and then shutting down the app? The answer was that it should not be possible.</p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>All users could imagine using the app. It creates excitement not to know how the person you are talking to looks and it is good that it 
            is possible to communicate via chat and text. All the testers agreed that communication begins via chat and if it clicks, you may switch to talking.
            If PiXER is to be built on, more research needs to be done on what values need to be included and how many are needed to be able to make good matches.
            Age needs to be added to get good matches.
            More tests need to be done to evaluate whether "Want children" is a criterion that is missing when matching. Thinking that this can vary greatly depending on age.</p>
